# ShakespeareTranslator
Translate from Modern to Shakespearean english! A seq2seq translation model with attention built in Tensorflow. 

Data was scraped from [www.litcharts.com](https://www.litcharts.com/shakescleare/shakespeare-translations) using beautiful soup to create a dataset of every Shakespearean play. Tensorflow was then used to create a language model which translates modern english into shakespeare.
